# Customer Satisfaction Prediction
# Looking for line

This project uses multiple linear regression to predict customer satisfaction based on factors such as service quality, pricing, and waiting time. It was developed as part of my learning journey in data science and machine learning.

## Overview

The goal is to identify which factors have the most influence on customer satisfaction using a real-world-like dataset (`Sale-Hair-CustSatisfaction.csv`) with 100 observations and 12 features.

### Key Features:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing and handling missing values
- Feature selection and correlation analysis
- Multiple Linear Regression model
- Model evaluation with RMSE, MAE, RÂ²

## Tools & Libraries

- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib & seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Model Performance

- **Train RMSE**: 0.5982  
- **Test RMSE**: 0.5016  
- **Train MAE**: 0.4779  
- **Test MAE**: 0.4000  
- **R-squared**: 0.7273  
- **Adjusted R-squared**: 0.7060  

These metrics show that the model captures a good portion of the variance in customer satisfaction.

## Dataset

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-satisfaction-prediction.git


2. Open `notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run the cells in order

Make sure to install dependencies if needed:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

##  Learning Outcome

This project helped me understand:

* How to prepare and explore a dataset
* Linear regression assumptions and diagnostics
* How to interpret and evaluate a regression model

## About Me

I'm a Computer Science student exploring data science and AI. I'm currently seeking remote internship opportunities to grow and contribute to real-world data-driven projects.
